## INTRODUCTION
This case study is the Capstone Project of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The 6 steps of Data Analysis is used to present this analysis.
* Title: Bellabeat Case Study
* Author: Caleb Ugorji
* Date: 14 October 2022

## STEP 1: ASK 
#### 1.0	BACKGROUND
Bellabeat has, Since 2013,  produced high-tech, exquisitely crafted smart goods for women that are focused on their health. Bellabeat has quickly expanded and established itself as a tech-driven wellness brand for women by educating and motivating women about their own health and behaviors.
Urka Sren, co-founder and chief creative officer, is sure that a study of non-Bellebeat customer data, such as usage data from FitBit activity trackers, would find greater room for expansion.

#### 1.2 BUSINESS TASK
Analyze FitBit Fitness Tracker Data to gain insights into how consumers are using the FitBit app and discover trends and insights for Bellabeat marketing strategy.

#### 1.3 Business Objectives:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? 
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

#### 1.4 Deliverables:
1.	A clear summary of the business task
2.	A description of all data sources used
3.	Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4.	A summary of analysis
5.	Supporting visualizations and key findings
6.	High-level content recommendations based on the analysis

#### 1.5 Key Stakeholders:
1.	Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer
2.	Sando Mur: Mathematician, Bellabeat’s cofounder and key member of the Bellabeat executive team
3.	Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts guiding Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## STEP 2: PREPARE

#### 2.1 Information on Data Source:
1.	The FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, which is recorded in 18 csv files, is made available to the public on Kaggle
2.	Generated by participants in a survey that was sent by Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 12 and May 12, 2016.
3.	30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
4.	Data collected includes (1) physical activity recorded in minutes, (2) heart rate, (3) sleep monitoring, (4) daily activity and (5) steps.

#### 2.2 Limitations of Data Set:
1.	Information was gathered in 2016. Data may not be current or relevant because users' daily activities, exercise routines, sleeping habits, diets, and food consumption may have changed since then.
2.	The sample size of 30 female FitBit users is too small to be typical of all females.
3.	Since data is gathered through a survey, it is impossible to determine the validity or veracity of the data.

#### 2.3 Is Data ROCCC?
A good data source should be ROCCC which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.
* Reliable-  Because there are just 30 responders, it is not very reliable.
* Original – The data was provided by a third party provider hence the originality is low (Amazon Mechanical Turk)
* Comprehensive-  Since the parameters are compatible with the majority of Bellabeat's product parameters, It is comprehensive to an extent.
* Current -The data is outdated and irrelevant by 6 years.
* Cited - Data obtained from a third party, hence unknown
Overall, the dataset is regarded as having low quality data, and it is not advised to base business suggestions on it.

#### 2.4 Data Selection

## STEP 3: PROCESS
We are using SQL to prepare and process the data.
* We checked to see which column names are shared across tables.
* We ensured that the columns had the right datatype
* We checked for irregularities in shared columns
* WE joined some tables

## STEP 4: ANALYZE
4.1 Perform calculations
Extracted the month of the year and the day of the week from the activitydate.
Pulled descriptive statistics and some aggregations on the joined table

Interpreting statistical findings:
* The app is used more in weekdays than in weekdays
* The users walk longer distance in weekends (Sunday and Saturday)
* Some users of the app use it for just 15 hours in a day. The average usage time from the 33 users is 20.3 hours.
* Users use the app to track sedentary activities which contributes minimally to reduction of calories. 
* Highest amount of calories are lost on Tuesdays which has the highest very active minutes.
* The average calories burnt by the users is 2303.6. Which is less than the calories needed to be burnt in order to lose 1 pound.
* Sedentary users are the majority logging on average 991 minutes or 20 hours making up 81% of total average minutes.

## STEP 5: SHARE
In this step, we are creating visualizations and communicating our findings based on our analysis.

#### 5.1 Data Visualisation and Findings
Dashboards were built using Tableau to show the visualizations and findings

## STEP 6: ACT
In the final step, we will be delivering our insights and providing recommendations based on our analysis.

##### Here, we revisit our business questions and share with you our high-level business recommendations.

1. What are the trends identified?
* Majority of users (81.3%) are using the FitBit app to track sedentary activities and not using it for tracking their health habits.
* Users prefer to track their activities during weekdays as compared to weekends - perhaps because they spend more time outside on weekdays and stay in on weekends.
* Users walk longer steps in the weekend, perhaps they use the app to track their steps when they go jogout in weekends

2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
* Both companies create goods that encourage women to understand their existing routines and make smart decisions by giving them information about their fitness, habits, and health. Customers of Bellabeat may very well use these widespread trends in health and fitness.

3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
* The Bellabeat marketing team can motivate users by enlightening and empowering them with knowledge about the advantages of fitness, suggesting various forms of exercise (for example, a straightforward 10 minute exercise on weekdays and a more intense exercise on weekends), and providing information on calorie intake and burn rate on the Bellabeat app.
* The Bellabeat app can also send out notifications  on the weekends to urge users to work out.
